# Characterizing changes in the spatiotemporal sensitivity of extrastriate neurons across a saccadic eye movements in the population of V4 and MT neurons

Using temporally and spatially precise measurement of V4 and MT receptive fields (RFs) around the time of saccades, we have observed various changes in the spatiotemporal sensitivy of individual extrastriate neurons. We have discovered a novel extrastriate mechanism for the maintenance of visual information across saccades. A subpopulation of extrastriate neurons shows persistent activity, maintaining the information from their original RF across the saccade. We also observe saccade target (ST) and future field (FF) remapping, in which neurons preemptively shift their sensitivity towards the saccade target or their future RF. 
In order to trace the perisaccadic changes in the neuron's spatiotemporal sensitivity on the timescale of a saccade, we develop a novel extension of the generalized linear model framework to capture perisaccadic changes in neuronsâ€™ visual responses, and decompose perisaccadic responses at each timepoint into multiple independent sources. We then characterize individual sources of perisaccadic responses (RF, FF, ST) quantitatively as a function of several variables representing the organization of the neuron's RF during fixation as well as the eye movement signal.
